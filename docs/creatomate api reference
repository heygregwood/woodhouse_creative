1. OVERVIEW
Creatomate is a media automation platform that allows developers and businesses to generate videos, images, and GIFs programmatically. The platform offers multiple integration methods: a REST API for cloud-based rendering, a JSON-based format called RenderScript for flexible video design, and a Preview SDK for browser-based rendering.
Key Features:

Cloud-based video and image rendering
REST API for programmatic access
Browser-based preview SDK
Template-based and code-based approaches
No-code automation integrations (Zapier, Make.com, n8n, Pabbly)
Support for dynamic and personalized content generation


2. QUICK START GUIDE
Getting Started with the API
To create a video or image, you only need a single API request to the Creatomate endpoint.
Authentication
Every API request requires your project's API key, found in your Project Settings. Include it in the request header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
Method 1: Create a Video by Template
Templates are pre-designed video structures created in the Creatomate editor that you can customize dynamically.
Steps:

Create a template in your account using the online editor
Send an API request to modify template elements using the modifications parameter
The API processes and returns your rendered video

Example cURL Request:
bashcurl -X POST https://api.creatomate.com/v2/renders \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \\
  -d '{
    "template_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID_HERE",
    "modifications": {
      "Primary-Text": "This text is placed in the video",
      "Background-Video": "https://cdn.creatomate.com/demo/video1.mp4"
    }
  }'
Modifying Template Attributes:
Use dot notation to change specific properties:
bashcurl -X POST https://api.creatomate.com/v2/renders \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \\
  -d '{
    "template_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID_HERE",
    "modifications": {
      "Primary-Text.font_family": "Montserrat",
      "Secondary-Text.time": 4.53,
      "Background-Color-2.fill_color": "#c3c615",
      "Outro-Composition": {}
    }
  }'
Method 2: Create a Video by RenderScript
RenderScript is a JSON-based format for describing videos from scratch, providing complete control over video structure and content.
Simple Example:
bashcurl -X POST https://api.creatomate.com/v2/renders \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \\
  -d '{
    "output_format": "mp4",
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "duration": 3,
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "My first video generated with RenderScript!",
        "fill_color": "#ff0000",
        "width": "50%",
        "height": "25%"
      }
    ]
  }'
Hybrid Approach: Injecting RenderScript into Templates:
bashcurl -X POST https://api.creatomate.com/v2/renders \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \\
  -d '{
    "template_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID_HERE",
    "modifications": {
      "elements.add": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "This text element is inserted to an existing template",
          "y": "28%",
          "width": "88%",
          "fill_color": "#ffffff"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## **3. REST API REFERENCE**

### **3.1 Create a Render**

**Endpoint:**
```
POST https://api.creatomate.com/v2/renders
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Optional | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `template_id` | string | Yes | The ID of the template created in the editor. Omit this to use RenderScript directly. |
| `modifications` | string/object | Yes | Changes to apply to the template before rendering. Learn more about modifications. |
| `render_scale` | number | Yes | The scale at which to render. Default: 1.0 (100%). Range: 0.1 to 10. |
| `max_width` | number | Yes | Scales output so width never exceeds this number. Combines with max_height; overrides render_scale. |
| `max_height` | number | Yes | Scales output so height never exceeds this number. Combines with max_width; overrides render_scale. |
| `webhook_url` | string | Yes | URL called when the render succeeds or fails. |
| `metadata` | string | Yes | Custom value passed to the webhook URL. |

**Response:**
Returns a render object containing:
- `id`: Unique render identifier
- `status`: Current render state (planned, waiting, transcribing, rendering, succeeded, failed)
- `url`: Download link (active when status is "succeeded")
- Other metadata and properties

### **3.2 Get the Status of a Render**

**Endpoint:**
```
GET https://api.creatomate.com/v2/renders/RENDER_ID
Description:
Retrieves the current status of a render. Images typically render within seconds; videos may take longer. Polling is not recommended for large batches—use webhooks instead.
Response Example:
json{
  "id": "a862048b-d0dc-4029-a4ef-e172e8ded827",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "url": "https://cdn.creatomate.com/renders/a862048b-d0dc-4029-a4ef-e172e8ded827.mp4",
  "snapshot_url": "https://cdn.creatomate.com/snapshots/a862048b-d0dc-4029-a4ef-e172e8ded827.jpg",
  "output_format": "mp4",
  "render_scale": 1,
  "width": 1280,
  "height": 720,
  "frame_rate": 60,
  "duration": 3,
  "file_size": 10804
}
```

### **3.3 Set Up a Webhook**

**Purpose:**
Webhooks provide automatic notifications when renders complete or fail, eliminating the need for polling.

**Configuration:**
- **Project-level:** Set a default webhook URL in Project Settings
- **Per-render:** Specify `webhook_url` when creating a render

**Webhook Payload:**
The webhook receives a POST request containing the complete render object (same structure as render status response).

**Metadata:**
Include custom data using the `metadata` parameter when initiating a render, which will be included in the webhook payload.

### **3.4 Retrieve Templates**

#### **Get All Templates in a Project**

**Endpoint:**
```
GET https://api.creatomate.com/v1/templates
Description:
Returns a list of all templates in your project with metadata.

4. RENDERSCRIPT
What is RenderScript?
RenderScript is a JSON-based format for defining videos, images, and GIFs. It serves as the foundation of all Creatomate functionality—even templates are built on RenderScript. Think of it as "HTML for video creation."
Key Concepts:
Elements: RenderScript documents consist of elements (text, video, images, compositions, audio, etc.) with properties that define appearance, timing, animations, and effects.
Compositions: Logical groupings of elements that can contain sub-elements, enabling complex nested structures.
Animations: Effects and transitions applied to elements with configurable timing and easing.
Tracks: Layering system for organizing elements (track 1, 2, 3, etc.) to control stacking order.
Why Use RenderScript Directly?

Generate completely dynamic videos without templates
Perform operations beyond simple template modifications
Combine template base structures with programmatic customization
Build flexible video generation pipelines

RenderScript Elements:
Common element types include:

text: Display text with customizable fonts, colors, sizes
video: Embed video files with transitions and effects
audio: Add background music and sound effects
image: Include images with animations
shape: Draw rectangles, circles, and other shapes
composition: Group related elements together
And many more specialized types


5. PREVIEW SDK
What is the Preview SDK?
The Preview SDK is a JavaScript library that brings real-time video rendering to the browser. It complements the cloud API by allowing users to preview videos and images before final rendering.
Key Features:

Real-time Preview: Display live previews of videos and images in the browser as users edit
Interactive Editing: Build platforms where users can customize videos with live feedback
Same Format: Uses identical JSON format as the REST API (no conversion needed)
Framework-Independent: Works with vanilla JavaScript or any modern framework

Limitations:
The Preview SDK cannot generate final MP4 files in the browser due to hardware constraints. Final rendering must occur through the Creatomate API.
Installation:
The Preview SDK is published as a JavaScript library on NPM.com:
bashnpm install @creatomate/preview-sdk
Minimum Requirements:
Hardware:

Desktop devices only (not mobile)
Modern computers with adequate GPU capabilities

Browsers:

Optimal: Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
Supported: Safari and Firefox (may have reduced smoothness)

Performance:
Performance depends heavily on device capabilities. The Preview SDK includes optimizations for smooth editing but older devices may not provide adequate experience.
Recommended Implementation:
Detect user's browser capabilities and initialize Preview SDK only when supported. For unsupported browsers, fall back to the Creatomate API for low-resolution quick renders.

6. INTEGRATION METHODS
6.1 Direct API Integration
Make HTTP requests to the Creatomate REST API from your application using your preferred programming language.
Supported Languages:

cURL
Node.js
PHP
Python
Ruby
C#
Go
Java

6.2 No-Code Automation
Creatomate is officially supported by popular no-code platforms:
Zapier: Beginner-friendly platform for creating automation workflows without code. Integrates with 8,000+ apps.
Make.com: Formerly Integromat. Better suited for advanced automation workflows with more complex logic.
n8n: Low-code automation platform offering balance between no-code solutions and custom development.
Pabbly: Alternative automation platform with Creatomate support.
Bubble.io: For building custom web applications with Creatomate integration.
6.3 Browser-based with Preview SDK
Build custom video editing applications using the Preview SDK for real-time preview, then use the API for final rendering.

7. LIMITS AND CONCURRENCY
API Rate Limit
Limit: 30 requests per 10-second window
Response on Limit Exceeded: 429 Too Many Requests
Recommendation: For applications expecting usage spikes, implement a queue mechanism to distribute API requests over time.
Calculation: With proper queuing and webhook integration, the rate limit allows for 10,000+ video/image requests per hour.
Render Concurrency
Concurrency refers to the number of videos/images processed simultaneously.
Key Points:

You can enqueue 30 videos every 10 seconds (within rate limit)
Enqueued renders may wait in queue if many are already processing
Queue has no limit—all renders eventually complete
Subscription plan determines concurrent render slots and queue priority

Usage Flexibility:

Generally, each customer can use ~20% of monthly quota within 24 hours
Example: With 200,000 monthly credits, you can process ~40,000 credits per day
This allows using entire 30-day allowance in about 5 days if needed

Best Practices:

Use Webhooks: More efficient than polling for status updates
Implement Queuing: Distribute API requests to stay within rate limits
Monitor Usage: Track credit consumption and plan accordingly
